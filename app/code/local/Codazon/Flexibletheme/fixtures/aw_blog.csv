With the iPhone, new looks only come at the top end.</p>
<p>That X is tempting indeed, but my only real-world experience with the device is the brief time I spent with it at Apple's Sept. 12 launch event. Until I can eventually get one and put it through its paces, I strongly recommend that you refrain from buying any phone whatsoever.</p>
<p>But if you need a phone right now, or if you have no desire to pay the iPhone X premium, let's talk practical considerations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The iPhone 8's best feature is its processor, a fast new six-core A11 Bionic chip, similar to the processor in the iPhone X and 8 Plus. Thanks to an all-new image sensor, photo quality has improved in low light, as has video quality. The iPhone 8 adds an improved iPad-style True Tone screen, and the speakers sound nice and loud. All the new iPhones include wireless charging now, thanks to a glass back.</p>
<p>If you have an&nbsp;<span class=""link""><a href=""#"">iPhone 7</a></span>, you'll find the faster speed, better screen and better camera on the iPhone 8 ""nice to have,"" but short of ""must-buy"" territory -- unless you're particularly enamored with the wireless charging Android owners have enjoyed for years.</p>

The speed, screen, audio and camera improvements will feel significant, and you'll get nice upgrades you missed when you skipped the iPhone 7, including water resistance.</p>
<p>So, yeah: That iPhone X may look great in the showroom window. But ultimately, you're driving off the lot with the practical four-door crossover. It's more affordable. It gets perfectly decent gas mileage. But it still has the same nice high-end navigation package, entertainment system and fuel-injected engine as that sweet low-slung coupe. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>That's the iPhone 8. The baseline 2017 iPhone remains a top-tier smartphone -- a seriously good phone. Just don't expect it to turn heads.</p>

"Canon got it right on International Women's Day","<p>""For International Women's Day, Canon..."" as I read the subject line of the email, I cringe at the possible endings to that sentence.</p>
<p>Not outside the realm of possibilities is something like, ""Releases Commemorative Pink Camera Strap!"" In 2018 I think we're better than that. Probably. I keep reading.</p>
<p>""...Lends Support to 'Women Photograph'"" is how it ends, and I feel a real sense of relief. This was an organization I knew and had covered in the past. It aims to 'elevate the voices of female visual journalists,' offering an additional resource for editors as well as grants and workshops for female photographers. I read on.</p>
<p>""Canon will work with Women Photograph to aid their travel grant program which funds female and non-binary photographers to attend workshops, hostile environment trainings, festivals, and other developmental opportunities.""</p>

<p>If you're a brand looking to grab a slice of the #MeToo pie, you could definitely do much worse than this. Case in point: McDonald's put on a master class this year in getting it wrong. The fast food giant announced that it would be turning its logo upside down to recognize International Women's Day... a ""W"" instead of an ""M""... for women... get it? Critics spoke up quickly, pointing out that it felt like an empty gesture coming from a company that can afford to do much more.</p>
<p>The upside down arches were on my mind when I started reading that press release from Canon this morning, so it felt very reassuring to see the brand pledging real support behind an effort created by, and created for, women photographers. Sure, it's all marketing at the end of the day, and I truly hope Canon's support of Women Photograph doesn't begin and end with a one-time workshop. Issuing a press release is cheap. Following through, and staying committed in the long term isn't.</p>

<p>But if you're going to talk about supporting women on International Women's Day, please don't just give us an empowering logo and a T-shirt.

"7 Easy Tips for Celebrating Galentine’s Day","<p>They&rsquo;re your secret-keepers, your supportive soul sisters, your ride or die: your gal pals that mean the world to you. So naturally, having a celebration devoted to appreciating them for all they do is a fantastic one, and what better way than to have a Galentine&rsquo;s Day celebration?</p>
<p>What is Galentine&rsquo;s Day? We&rsquo;re not even going to touch this one, when Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) of Parks and Recreation fame sums it up perfectly:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and boyfriends at home, and we come and kick it breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It&rsquo;s like Lilith Fair minus the angst&hellip;plus frittatas!</p>
<p>From that moment in 2010, a fictional holiday gave birth to a real-life tradition with an almost fanatic following, with women everywhere declaring that this needed to be a real thing. And why not? What could better than getting together with the women you love and admire to celebrate friendship and gratitude for each other in a fun and meaningful way, complete with (let&rsquo;s face it) two favorite food groups? Fizzy cocktails and whipped cream (not necessarily in that order).</p>
<p>So whether you&rsquo;re into brunchin&rsquo;, lunchin&rsquo;, or midnight munchin&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re hooking you up with some simple tips for paying homage to your squad on Feb 13th that will definitely deliver all the feels to the girls who run your world.</p>
<p>Your Galentine&rsquo;s Day party planning checklist</p>
<h3>Galentine's Day</h3>
<p>1. Invites &mdash;party&rsquo;s at your place! (Or restaurant, or wherever you and the gals like to hang).Grab some cards and announce to your she-ros that you&rsquo;re hosting a Galentine&rsquo;s Day gathering to celebrate female friendship!</p>
<p>2. Gifts for your guests. If you&rsquo;re thinking of handing out gifts to the gals, check out our gift guide for some fun and thoughtful ideas that will make them feel special. Galentine's Day</p>
<p>3. Favors that leave a lasting impression. You can scour Pinterest for hours for tons of fun ideas, but we love the idea of giving a feeling that will never fade. Head to your party supply store for heart-shaped balloons for each of your guests. Before filling with helium, write one thing you love about each guest on a paper heart and fold it up tight. Insert into your balloon (use a funnel and push through with erasure side of a pencil!), fill with helium, and add a ribbon. (Be sure to keep track of whose balloon is whose by using different colored balloons or attaching different colored ribbons. Not only will the balloons add to your d&eacute;cor, but guests can later pop their balloon at home to receive your meaningful message &ndash; priceless.</p>
<p>4. Get your groove on. Prep a music playlist about friends, or include songs that have stories behind them that you shared with various ladies in attendance. (You know you have them. Like the time you walked out of the bathroom at the diner with your skirt tucked into your underwear just as &ldquo;Girl on Fire&rdquo; came on the radio.) Galentine's Day</p>
<p>5. Bring on the bubbly. It&rsquo;s never too early for champagne (it&rsquo;s practically the new orange juice),so if you&rsquo;re kickin&rsquo; it brunch style, Mimosas are an easy way to go. If you want something red and berry-ish to suit the mood, try ros&eacute; sparkling wine and add raspberries or pomegranate. Another easy choice is orange vodka, cranberry juice, and club soda topped with orange slices. Plus, these can easily be made non-alcoholic by simply leaving out the alcohol. (But we didn&rsquo;t; just saying.)</p>
<p>6. A toast to friendship. (clink clink!) A few words to warm the heart always make for a meaningful moment. If you want to go straight for the jugular, you might try something like: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s around the table that friends understand best, the warmth of being together&rdquo; &ndash; Anonymous.</p>
<p>Or, go for fun: &ldquo;True friendship is when you walk into their house and your WiFi connects automatically&rdquo; &ndash; Author Unknown (internet probably). We can hook you up with even more ideas if you hop over to our What to Write page. These ideas work well as a toast in addition</p>
<p>to messages you can write in your cards. (Cue all the feels!)</p>
<p>Galentine's Day7. Cards for everyone! What would Galentine&rsquo;s Day be without a &ldquo;tine&rdquo; for every gal? (We just made that up. It&rsquo;s the fizzy drinks). Of course, you&rsquo;ll probably want to make sure each person in attendance is given a warm expression of how much they mean, and since you just saw our What to Write ideas, you&rsquo;re all set! Simply head here to pick your favorite cards. Or, you might want to give everyone a Thank You card for coming and, more importantly, for being the good friend you feel so lucky to have. Galentine's DayOur girlfriends are like our second family. These days, with the world spinning faster every second (so it seems), it&rsquo;s important to keep them close, and a little gratitude goes a long way in showing them how much they mean to us. Leslie Knope said, &ldquo;Anytime a group of women get together, we embody the spirit of the holiday.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll go one further and add that &lsquo;we embody the spirit of friendship.&rsquo; Cheers to yours &mdash; Happy Galentine&rsquo;s Day!</p>","1","7-easy-tips-for-celebrating-galentine-s-day","Codazon Team","Nicolas Codazon","","","0","","<p>They&rsquo;re your secret-keepers, your supportive soul sisters, your ride or die: your gal pals that mean the world to you.

"‘Side Dishes That Steal The Show’ Contest Winner Announced","<p>Congratulations to Rhonda J Elfstrand &ndash; the winner of our Side Dishes That Steal The Show Recipe Contest!</p>
<p>Rhonda submitted her recipe for the tasty and popular Strawberry Pretzel Salad which turned out to be our favorite!</p>
<p>Here is the winning recipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mix 2 cups of crushed pretzels, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1/2 cup of melted butter and then press into the bottom of 9&times;13 pan. Bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees and allow the crust to cool completely before making the middle and top layers. Then beat 8 ounces of cream cheese and 1 cup of sugar until smooth. Fold in 8 ounces of Cool Whip until it is all incorporated. Spread the mixture evenly (beware the loose crumbs of the crust) on the cooled crust. For the top layer sprinkle 6 ounces of stawberry Jello on 2 cups of near boiling water into a large bowl and stir well. Carefully add 10-16 ounces of frozen strawberries and stir until Jello is slightly thickened (the frozen strawberries do a &ldquo;quick set&rdquo; of the Jello). Pour the mixture evenly over the middle layer, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed &ndash; at least two hours.&rdquo;</p>

If I am not mistaking, I at least own 7 pairs of white sneakers. (Yeah, that's how much I love them) I just can't hold myself back when I spot a pair of good white sneakers, online or in store.

The special feature of the shoe: The pattern of the BVG seat covers serves as a design element of the sneaker and makes it a collector&rsquo;s item.

"How to Create a Dining Room in Small Spaces","<p>Everyone wants to enjoy a dining room, but not everyone has the space to accommodate a traditional one. Living in big cities means making sacrifices, and dining rooms are usually the first amenities to go. It&rsquo;s the bathtub of rooms, since it routinely gets left out of many designs. Just because your landlord didn&rsquo;t think it was necessary doesn&rsquo;t mean that it doesn&rsquo;t leave a mark. It&rsquo;s the most common thing renters miss, since they are reminded of its absence during every meal.</p>
<p>From living in dorms to cramped apartments, everyone has had to get creative to make a dining room. Fortunately, melding a dining room into a kitchen or workspace is easier than most people think. With a few innovations, making a dining room is relatively simple. In this situation simple is better, so there&rsquo;s no reason to go overboard. Instead of blowing your budget on high-end products, it&rsquo;s time to think outside the box. For this reason, we compiled a list of ways to make a dining room fit anywhere. These tips are a godsend for cramped living, so win back your right to eat comfortably!</p>
<h1>Tips For Creating a Dining Room In Cramped Conditions</h1>
<p>Tip #1: Utilize Unused Spaces &ndash; Usually a small apartment means that all the wall space is already being used. From sofas to counters, there&rsquo;s rarely space for new additions. Get around this inconvenient truth by installing a wooden counter across a window. This innovation provides the perfect caf&eacute; window seat without encroaching on your d&eacute;cor!</p>
<p>Tip #2: Tuck It into the Wall &ndash; Everything foldable is a small apartment renters best friend. From high top tables to bars, there&rsquo;s no excuse for settling for bulky furniture. Tucking it into the wall is the best option, so don&rsquo;t miss out on this deviance from the norm!</p>
<p>Tip #3: Use the Right Seating &ndash; Picking the right furniture is just as important as finding the right spot to install them. Instead of taking up space with chairs, use stools that are easily pressed against the wall. These take up little to no real estate, which is perfect when space is tight. Take a look at our wide selection of Modern Stools to discover the design that&rsquo;s ideal for your d&eacute;cor!</p>","1","how-to-create-a-dining-room-in-small-spaces","Codazon","Nicolas Codazon","How to Create a Dining Room in Small Spaces","How to Create a Dining Room in Small Spaces","0","Home design, dining room","<p>Everyone wants to enjoy a dining room, but not everyone has the space to accommodate a traditional one.

" Occasional Table for Office","<p>Occasional chairs can be used in a variety of business settings to make an environment more inviting, endearing, and comfortable. Offices, retail spaces, restaurants, and more industries can make use of modern occasional chairs. They can add a touch of modernity, accent colours, or simply be a practical place to sit.</p>
<p>sohoConcept designs and manufactures modern occasional chairs that can be used in these settings and more. Find out how an occasional chair can spruce up your business or draw attention to your décor.</p>
<h1>Office Guest Chairs and Reception Seating</h1>
<p>Occasional chairs can be used different ways in offices to make them more comfortable for both guests and employees.</p>
<p>Occasional guest chairs can be used in offices for job interviewees, clients, and other visitors to sit in an employee’s office. These need to be welcoming and comfortable. sohoConcept’s Harput Wood Lounge chair is a great example of an occasional chair that provides comfort while still looking professional.</p>
<p>Modern occasional chairs can also be used for reception seating in the lobby or entrance of your office. The Chelsea Sled chair is narrow and thin, meaning many can fit in a small waiting area comfortably.</p>
<p>For casual meeting areas, bright and big occasional chairs can be used. The Crescent 4 Star Lounge or Dervish Swivel High Back draw attention to themselves and in bright colours, can bring an element of fun and relaxation to a meeting area in an office. They’re a great solution if you’re looking for contemporary office chairs.</p>
<h1>Fitting Room Seating</h1>
<p>Retail stores can also make use of occasional chairs. Shop décors range from understated, to bright, to modern, to colourful. Occasional chairs by sohoConcept can complement and accommodate any stylistic theme in a retail shop.</p>
<p>Occasional chairs can be used anywhere in a shop. Decoration, accent pieces, for mannequins, or for displays – these are all great ways to incorporate them into your shop’s design. They can also be used in fitting rooms in a variety of ways. They can be used in the changing rooms themselves to give your customers somewhere to sit or put clothes while they are trying things on. They can also be used outside the fitting rooms to give their friends and family somewhere to sit.</p>
<p>Because every retail shop is different, the style of modern occasional chair for fitting rooms will be different as well. sohoConcept offers a variety of colours and styles that will fit with any retail décor.</p>
<h1>Wholesale Restaurant Furniture</h1>
<p>While modern dining chairs are the dominant seating in restaurants, occasional chairs can contribute to the atmosphere as well. They can be used in waiting or lounge areas in the restaurant, takeout area, or bar to give customers more seating options. Regular dining chairs can be used here, but occasional chairs often provide a better, more comfortable feeling for your customers.</p>
<p>Another unique way to use modern occasional chairs in restaurants is as the heads of tables. Using regular dining chairs around a large table with just one occasional chair at the head is a great way to accent the décor and make each table a little bit different. sohoConcept’s wholesale restaurant furniture, like the Rebecca Wire chair or Dervish Wood High Back chair, are as comfortable as dining chairs, but are larger and can make a statement as the head of the table. Your customers will love the break from tradition!</p>","1","occasional-chairs-for-business","Codazon","Nicolas Codazon","3 Color Changes Every Home Needs in 2018","3 Color Changes Every Home Needs in 2018","0","","<p>Occasional chairs can be used in a variety of business settings to make an environment more inviting, endearing, and comfortable.

"Why Aren’t PDMPs More Effective in Fighting Opioid Abuse?","<p>Long before the opioid epidemic was thought to be a public health emergency, prescription drug abuse and misuse were steadily increasing in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat this, states and hospitals have been building technological platforms to enable prescription drug monitoring programs that can the&nbsp;track habits of both prescribers and patients. But use of PDMPs varies by state, with some states mandating its use and others merely recommending that hospitals and medical groups opt-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Trump administration saying it will crack down on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/opioid"" target=""_blank"">opioid</a>&nbsp;abuse, it begs the question: Could these data-heavy platforms make a dent in the crisis?</p>
<h2>Every state but Missouri</h2>
<p>As it stands, every state has its own&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMP</a>, outside of Missouri -- the state has made multiple attempts and failures to implement a statewide platform. And 46 of U.S. states are part of the collaborative PMP InterConnect, an interstate group started by Appriss Health in 2011 that fosters prescription drug data sharing across state lines.</p>
<p>But whether PDMP use can truly impact the opioid crisis is yet to be determined. A 2017&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5477729/"" target=""_blank"">study</a>&nbsp;by University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and Northwestern researchers found PDMP use effects remain mixed.</p>
<p>On the one hand, researchers found an underlying link between PDMPs and a reduction of misuse and diversion. Further, many of the programs provide a detailed prescribing history of a patient over the course of the past three months.</p>
<p>While the use of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMPs</a>&nbsp;obviously reduces the number of opioids prescribed within a state, the researchers pointed out a number of issues that PDMPs&nbsp;could impact. Namely, the &lsquo;chilling effect,&rsquo; which could deprive patients of necessary pain medications.</p>
<p>Further, even when&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/opioid"" target=""_blank"">opioid</a>&nbsp;prescriptions were reduced, the researchers also found that it didn&rsquo;t reduce overdose mortality rates in states overall.</p>
<p>Another recent study by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/COE_documents/Add_to_TTAC/Briefing%20on%20PDMP%20Effectiveness%203rd%20revision.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pew</a>&nbsp;Charitable Trusts outlines the obvious effects of PDMP use: identifying and reducing doctor shopping, controlled substance availability and prescribing, reduced medical and drug costs related to inappropriate prescribing, and improved health outcomes for some states.</p>
<p>But those benefits vary by state and are also hard to determine, as it&rsquo;s not possible to conduct a controlled study. And there are so many interventions going on in states right now, explained Cynthia Reilly, director of Pew Charitable Trusts Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[PDMPs] have a benefit,&rdquo; said Reilly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen nationally that there&rsquo;s been a decrease of the prescribing of opioids and PDMPs are a contributor. There&rsquo;s also evidence that use of PDMPs can improve prescribing decisions and decrease the abuse of opioids, and to a lesser extent that shows it improves patient outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/how-michigan-kicked-its-pdmp-notch-clamp-down-doctors-overprescribing-opioids"" target=""_blank"">Michigan</a>&nbsp;is one of the states leading the PDMP charge. It implemented its PDMP in 2003, which was updated in recent years to address tech challenges, by transitioning to Appriss -- the platform used by most states.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a result of improving that software, we&rsquo;ve seen an increase in the utilization of PDMP and a drop in volume of prescriptions,&rdquo; said Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs Acting Deputy Director Kim Gaedeke.</p>
<p>Both prescribers and dispensers are utilizing the platform to address potential risks. And the state has seen prescription drug deaths level off, said Appriss Health President Rob Cohen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the tools that is certainly central in the fight against the opioid epidemic,&rdquo; said Gaedeke. &ldquo;But now we&rsquo;re looking to understand how do we continue to innovate and make it better?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Data challenges</h2>
<p>While some states have made good progress, it&rsquo;s not a nationwide trend. There is still a lot of work to be done, explained Reilly. Part of that is due to regulations that vary by state, such as how long that data can be stored, among others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an ideal world we would want the information from a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMP</a>&nbsp;right in a prescriber workflow,&rdquo; said Reilly.</p>
<p>To David Kilgo, director of systems implementation at Wolters Kluwer Clinical Effectiveness, that&rsquo;s the biggest challenge: the difficulty of integrating PDMP into the prescriber&rsquo;s workflow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In many instances, the prescriber must leave the screens in an EHR, log into the state website, search for the patient name, possibly making several selections due to the variation of names, and then return to the EHR to complete the work,&rdquo; said Kilgo.</p>
<p>Part of that is due to software models, which were built at different times, explained Reilly. Trying to integrate that data has been a massive undertaking.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s partially due to &ldquo;the lack of a unique&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/chime-improved-data-sharing-patient-identifiers-needed-opioid-fight"" target=""_blank"">patient identifier</a>&nbsp;that can tie records across multiple pharmacies within a state,&rdquo; along with the &ldquo;lack of data availability across state boundaries,&rdquo; said Kilgo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine, for example, a clinician whose practice is near a state border,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Their state regulation may mandate validation of the prescription history of a patient, but only in the state where the clinician is based.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result, the data received about a patient&rsquo;s &lsquo;in-state&rsquo; activity, may only be a small portion of the relevant patient activity, Kilgo explained. &ldquo;The very nature of a retrospective submission versus a real-time submission can cause a delay that reduces the effectiveness of the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only that, but once in the PDMP system, the data often looks like a laundry list, explained Reilly. It makes it difficult to efficiently detect a prescribing issue or any overlapping data.</p>
<p>Adding to that issue is a lack of data standardization, explained Gaedeke. While most states are sharing data, it&rsquo;s not always efficient given the lack of standards around state processes and requirements.</p>
<p>Currently, Michigan is attempting to tackle this issue, by what Gaedeke hopes will be a standardized collection of data and the ability to make data available in real-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the key is that PDMP administrators need to collectively identify what kind of standard to agree upon - so sharing data becomes more seamless,&rdquo; said Gaedeke. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sharing today, but certainly we can improve on that process, especially if states agree on standards and protocols.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>The way forward</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMPs</a>&nbsp;were initially instated to ensure appropriate prescribing and to avoid patients being given too many&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/opioid"" target=""_blank"">opioids</a>. But it&rsquo;s time the platform improves to make better use of the data to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>I think the evolution of PDMPs and continued evolution is going to increasingly impact the opioid epidemic,&rdquo; said Cohen.</p>
<p>The next step, perhaps, would be to leverage that data to address opioid deaths, enable treatment through PDMPs and pour more data into the platform to gain more insights, explained Cohen.</p>
<p>States are already making those efforts to determine next steps, including determining innovative solutions, utilizing data-driven analytics and &ldquo;to hopefully guide potential policy decisions,&rdquo; Reilly explained. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re also looking into whether we&rsquo;re really making a dent [in the crisis] and whether we&rsquo;re seeing providers using the data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PDMPs would be more effective if the platform could actually better inform prescribers and identify patients at risk or those using dangerous combinations or high quantities of opioids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point of a PDMP isn&rsquo;t just to turn them away,&rdquo; said Reilly. &ldquo;The point, in an ideal world, would be to have a dialogue with a patient. Maybe their pain isn&rsquo;t being properly managed, for example. We&rsquo;ve also seen that prescribers will use the information to talk to patients about substance use disorder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too often PDMPs are looked at as a tool to impede access, but Reilly explained that those data and platform challenges stand in the way of prescribers having the time to make those crucial decisions.</p>
<p>To Gaedeke, machine learning and predictive analytics could be the key to making PDMP data more actionable. The tools could not just look at morbidity trends or frequency of patients receiving an opioid prescription, but to predict outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal would be to use those technologies to pull that data in so you can have better predictive modeling,&rdquo; said Gaedeke. &ldquo;The prescriber could see all of that data in terms of potential overdose death, and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usage increases, it could hopefully alert the prescriber that there&rsquo;s something going on with a patient, said Gaedeke. And if the patient continues down that path and the provider doesn&rsquo;t intervene, it will lead to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more we can predict that, the more effective PDMPs will be,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ultimate goal. The challenge becomes, how do you pull in all of the other data assets that could be helpful when trying to transform PDMPs to help us with the predictive modeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/directory/PDMP"" target=""_blank"">PDMPs</a>&nbsp;have &ldquo;such a wealth of information to inform prescribing, so how do we make sure more people are getting that information and using it?&rdquo; Reilly asked. That data can be helpful to determine hot spots of overprescribing and can help with more law enforcement engagements, along with helping patients get into treatment programs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough for states to mandate the use, as obviously &ldquo;if you require the use of PDMPs, prescribers are going to do it,&rdquo; said Reilly. The real questions are whether they&rsquo;re using it well and if not, how do regulators make that happen?</p>
<p>PDMP use is &ldquo;not just checking a box or jumping through hoops, it goes back to the idea of finding out what information is more informative to the prescriber and the best way to display it,&rdquo; said Reilly. &ldquo;And then, focus on getting it into the workflow and move toward e-prescribing.</p>
<p>Kilgo agreed that these improvements would be more helpful if more states adopted e-prescribing mandates.</p>
<p>For example, since New York adopted its e-prescribing mandate in 2016, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-yorks-opioid-fight-pdmp-now-interoperable-25-states-dc"" target=""_blank"">state</a>&nbsp;has reduced doctor shopping incidents by more than 98 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a fraud prevention perspective, speeding up the adoption of electronic prescribing of controlled substances across all states will minimize the opportunity for unscrupulous actors to falsify or forge documents,&rdquo; said Kilgo. &ldquo;It also creates a gate for opportunistic prescribers to pass through before establishing a practice that targets those seeking opioid products because of a substance use disorder.&rdquo;</p>","1","why-aren-t-pdmps-more-effective-in-fighting-opioid-abuse","Codazon","Nicolas Codazon","Why Aren’t PDMPs More Effective in Fighting Opioid Abuse?","Why Aren’t PDMPs More Effective in Fighting Opioid Abuse?","0","","<p><span>Every state outside of Missouri already has a PDMP in place, but issues with data standardization and differences in regulations inhibit their potential.</span></p>","codazon_blog/codazon_blog_1535598018.jpg","drug-pharmacy"
"Patient-centric Technology Improves Quality of Care","<h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
<p>The Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s primary objectives are to transform the current U.S. healthcare ecosystem into one that is:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>good for patients</span>, who can enjoy better health, share in their health decisions, and manage their expense effectively</li>
<li><span>good for the industry</span>, leading to overall cost-effective healthcare</li>
<li><span>good for physicians and other healthcare professionals</span>, enabling them to focus on delivery of optimal medical care</li>
<li><span>good for healthcare practices</span>, aligning practitioners, fostering collaboration, and working toward a single goal of delivery of optimal care</li>
</ol>
<p>If we were to rate the current progress of ACA, the healthcare sectors would have a lot going for them, but looking ahead, it may be a bumpy ride over the next few years with a lot more work required. As we benchmark the financial outlook for the first quarter of 2018, the positive indicators show healthcare companies&rsquo; balance sheets are strong, overall cost structures continue to improve, and stocks have good dividend yields. Continued demand appears to be on the rise for healthcare products and services, partly as a result of the growth of our aging population. Unfortunately, these positive factors are being countered by several negative indicators, including political volatility and uncertainty facing ACA and growing national deficit that could change some of the funding sources currently earmarked for the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Prior to the implementation of ACA, it was well recognized by both the public and private sector that our healthcare system was not sustainable and we were on the road toward the &ldquo;perfect storm.&rdquo; The growing swell was influenced by 18% of GNP directly attributed to healthcare and expected to rise to 30% of GNP by 2050; care demand on the rise with over 25% of the population having multiple chronic disease and growth of chronic disease predicted to grow 1% per year until 2030; and consumer-centric care driving health and wellness to avoid higher out of pocket financial subsidies and chronic conditions. Even more alarming were statistics such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>National average for readmissions to hospitals within 30 days following heart failure episodes: 20%</li>
<li>Patients&nbsp;65 and older cost over $26 billion annually</li>
<li>$17 billion spent annually on return hospital trips that wouldn&rsquo;t need to happen if patients received proper care the first time&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding to this trend is the fact that there will be a shortage of over 100,000 physicians by 2030.</p>
<h3>GAME ON</h3>
<p>Despite these mounting challenges, in today&rsquo;s healthcare system, providers are expected and incented to perform at a higher level. As a key healthcare supply chain stakeholder and the routine &ldquo;point of touch&rdquo; with the consumer, pharmacy also plays a critical role in patient engagement, stepping up and delivering long-term expected outcomes given the headwinds of continued pressures of lower reimbursement, more governmental oversight, and expanded scope of responsibilities relating to access and coverage, emphasizing quality and coordinated accountable care, and expanding emphasis on addressing chronic care conditions.</p>
<h2>Emerging Technology Connects with Consumers</h2>
<p>The key to achieving successful outcomes is developing a comprehensive consumer engagement strategy by optimizing bi-directional communication: When, where, and how you reach consumers matters. The key areas of opportunities include a platform for greater access, medication adherence,&nbsp;predictive analytics that would share insight from patient data for continuous and sustainable insight, and solutions that personalize management and optimize patient care.</p>
<p>By increasing the involvement of patients in their own healthcare, enabling them to manage their wallet spend and proactively avoid health problems and better manage their conditions, we create a changing&nbsp;<span>patient-centered technology ecosystem</span>. Emerging technology helps improve access, efficiency, and quality of care by putting the patient in the&nbsp;<em>center</em>&nbsp;of the digital experience to drive patient empowerment and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on feedback from the pharmacy community, here several key enabling technology initiatives that are being successfully integrated into business models:</p>
<p><span>Data, Data, Data!&nbsp;</span><em>Including data analytics, artificial intelligence interoperability, and collaboration</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligence and predictive analytics can drive patient behavior change</li>
<li>Data is located in a number of databases, and previously it has been cost-prohibitive and difficult to manage</li>
<li>With the power of technology, healthcare practitioners can begin collecting consolidated views of patients by connecting, cleansing, and joining all relevant data (clinical, insurance, demographics, and more regardless of systems or format) to improve the quality of care and outcomes, thus personalizing the consumer experience to drive the right treatment plan and behavior</li>
<li>Emerging application of artificial intelligence or machine learning for more uses can be a game changer for clinical decision support: The benefits of AI could potentially increase 20% productivity gains</li>
<li>AI-based enhanced EHR technology will aid clinicians, interpret data quickly, make medical and medication predictions, and help in decision making</li>
<li>Additionally, pharmacy is exploring the use of AI enabling removal of redundancy steps to provide for a more efficient and seamless workflow between healthcare providers</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span>Growth of Telehealth&nbsp;</span><em>Greater access, medication adherence, quality of care</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Telehealth continues to grow in 2018 with the rise of new telehealth solutions</li>
<li>Telehealth creates better patient access, engagement, experience, and virtual house call by pharmacy and other healthcare services</li>
<li>Telehealth meets the consumer access demand by encouraging preventative care and medication adherence; offers a lower-cost, immediately accessible care option, especially in rural regions or for those who are time-pressed. It also enables the elderly and physically-challenged to obtain regular healthcare services without leaving their homes</li>
<li>Additionally, data collected in these services will enable better cost- efficient coordinated care</li>
<li>According to many pharmacy executives and other healthcare professionals, telehealth is a high priority, and 76% will offer consumer health services in this area</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span>Smart Devices and Digital Medicine&nbsp;</span><em>Mobile platforms encourage better patient engagement resulting in better outcome</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Besides the growth of telehealth and telemedicine services, there are a number of mobile software initiatives encouraging better patient engagement resulting in better outcomes</li>
<li>We are seeing emerging smart technology integrated within commonly used medication/disease devices to improve patient engagement: Applications using Blue Tooth and /or Wi-Fi are becoming more prevalent to monitor, alert, and predict behavior and sharing patients&rsquo; information with their circle of friends, caregivers and family</li>
<li>Recently, digital medicine announced the debut of a ""<a href=""https://www.proteus.com/press-releases/otsuka-and-proteus-announce-the-first-us-fda-approval-of-a-digital-medicine-system-abilify-mycite/"">chip in a pill</a>,"" which provides the ability to monitor the physiology and behavior of patients receiving care&nbsp;for specific medical conditions, although there is a lot more evaluation needed on the impact of this technology</li>
</ul>
<p>As digital health technology continues to focus on patient empowerment and engagement, 2018 is likely to be a game-changer year for the healthcare sector, driving improved access and coverage and increased coordination and quality of care, ultimately leading to better management of the spend in our current healthcare system.</p>

"Non-opioids Just as Effective as Opioids in EDs","<p>Opioid analgesics remain the first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe acute pain in emergency departments. But a&nbsp;<a href=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661581"">study published in JAMA 2017</a>&nbsp;showed that, for patients presenting to the emergency department with acute extremity pain, there were no statistically significant nor clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours after single treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen compared with three different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, the study authors reiterated that opioid analgesics remain the first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe acute pain in emergency departments. Data from 2006-2010 confirm that opioids were prescribed for 18.7% of ED discharges.</p>
<p>The full study can be accessed at:&nbsp;<em>Chang AK, et al. &ldquo;Effect of a single dose of oral and non-opioid analgesics on acute extremity pain in the emergency department.&rdquo; JAMA 2017; 318(17):1661-1667.doi10.100/jama2017; 16190.</em></p>
<h2>Study Objectives</h2>
<p>A common, painful condition seen in emergency departments is extremity injuries. The condition is often treated with a single dose of an oral analgesic while awaiting further care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there are many analgesic options available in emergency departments, there is very little evidence with which to guide clinical choice of medication.</p>
<p>The study objective was to compare the degree of pain reduction at 2 hours after ingestion of four oral combination analgesics. Three of these combinations contained an opioid, one was non-opioid, and all four were combined with acetaminophen.</p>
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>The study was conducted in two urban emergency departments at the Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. Study authors were from Albany Medical College, Albany, NY, and Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center.</p>
<p>This was a prospective study, in which a randomized clinical trial&nbsp;included 415 patients, aged between 21 to 64 years, with moderate-to-severe acute extremity pain and enrolled from July 2015 to August 2016.</p>
<p>Extremity pain was defined as pain originating to and including shoulder joint in the upper extremity and distal to and including the hip joint in the lower extremities.</p>
<p>The primary outcome examined was the difference in decline of pain 2 hours after taking the assigned drug per group. The degree of pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale in which 0 indicated no pain and 10, the worst possible pain. Subjects were asked to rate their pain intensity using the numerical scale before taking analgesics and then at 1 hour and 2 hours following ingestion.</p>
<p>The investigators assigned a predefined minimum importance difference of 1.3, stating that this difference on a numerical rating scale is considered to be a standard previously derived and independently validated, based on reports, to indicate statistical significance. They added that a difference of 1.3 is a commonly used criterion to define minimal clinically important difference in pain. Analysis of variance was used to test the overall between group difference at P = 0.05%.</p>
<p>For the assigned drugs, there were 104 participants for each of four combination analgesic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1: 400 mg ibuprofen + 1000 mg acetaminophen</li>
<li>Group 2: 5 mg oxycodone + 325 mg acetaminophen</li>
<li>Group 3: 5 mg hydrocodone + 300 mg acetaminophen</li>
<li>Group 4: 30 mg codeine + 300 mg acetaminophen</li>
</ul>
<p>All drugs were formulated in opaque capsules so that they looked identical.</p>
<p>Subjects who required a rescue analgesic based on the discretion of the attending physician received an unblended 5 mg dose of oxycodone, which could be administered at any point during the 2-hour study period.</p>
<h3>RESULTS</h3>
<p>Out of 416 patients included in the study and randomized, 411 were selected for analysis. The sample included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Female: 48%</li>
<li>Latino: 60%</li>
<li>Black: 31%</li>
</ul>
<p>Baseline pain intensity was initially high (mean score 8.7 out of 10) and did not differ between medication groups.</p>
<p>Pain intensity declined over time in all groups. The magnitudes of decline were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 (ibuprofen): pain decreased by 4.3 over 2 hours</li>
<li>Group 2 (oxycodone): pain decreased by 4.4 over 2 hours</li>
<li>Group 3 (hydrocodone): pain decreased by 3.5 over 2 hours</li>
<li>Group 4 (codeine): pain decreased by 3.9 over 2 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest difference in decline in the NRS pain score from baseline to 2 hours was between the oxycodone and acetaminophen group and the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group (0.9), and that was less than the minimally important difference in NRS pain score of 1.3.</p>
<p>Seventy-three patients (17.8%) received rescue analgesics within the 2-hour period. The distribution of receipt of rescue analgesia was not statistically significant, nor was the amount received in morphine equivalent units any different across groups.</p>
<h2>Study Limitations and Conclusion</h2>
<p>The follow-up time was limited to only 2 hours. A longer follow-up would have provided additional information, but the study goal was to determine if a single dose of analgesic would provide superior pain relief for patients while in the emergency department.</p>
<p>Another limitation was that it was unknown whether the duration of analgesia differed among the analgesics, although the half-lives are similar and range between 3 and 4 hours. Yet another limitation was that adverse effect information was not collected. The degree of adverse effects could influence the analgesic selection, especially if one group had significantly more adverse effects than another group.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, this study showed that for patients presenting to the emergency department with acute extremity pain, there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2 hours among single-dose treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen or with three different opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics.</p>

"It’s Healthier for You and Better for the Environment","<p>Discover why it&rsquo;s important to buy local food, the health benefits of eating locally grown produce, and why choosing local food benefits the environment.</p>
<p>Have you wondered why it&rsquo;s important to buy local food?</p>
<p>Local food is now a mainstream trend, with more and more people seeking out fresh, local options for produce and other foods. And more restaurants are sourcing locally grown ingredients as well, often using the term farm-to-table.</p>
<p>But what is &ldquo;local&rdquo; food? How big of an impact does eating local food have on your health and the planet? And why is it important to know more about where your food comes from?</p>
<h1>What Is Local Food and Why Should You Care?</h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s no formal definition of the term local food. But one common definition of &ldquo;local&rdquo; food is food grown within 100 miles of its point of sale or consumption.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s up to you to decide what buying local food means to you. Maybe it means foods grown and produced in your state or your region. Or maybe it means that it comes from farmers you know and can talk to &mdash; for example, at a farmer&rsquo;s market or through a CSA. And for some people, &ldquo;local&rdquo; is more about the values of small-scale and community-based than about a specific geographic configuration.</p>
<p>More and more people want to know where their food comes from and the farming practices of the farmers that grow and produce it. And this is important for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps you develop a connection with food.</li>
<li>You become more aware of what you&rsquo;re putting in your body.</li>
<li>You vote every time you shop, and with knowledge comes the ability to support foods and growers you believe in.season doesn&rsquo;t have far to travel before being sold.</li>
<li>Why Buy Local Food? For One Thing, It May Be Better for Your Health</li>
</ul>
<p>Local food can be better for your health for a few reasons. To begin with, local foods often retain more nutrients. Local produce is allowed to ripen naturally, while food that travels long distances is often picked before it&rsquo;s ripe. And food picked fresh and in season doesn&rsquo;t have far to travel before being sold.</p>
<p>Another study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that the levels of health-promoting anthocyanin pigments more than quadrupled as blackberries became fully ripe.</p>
<p>In addition, locally grown produce may be safer. When they are imported and out of season, fruits like tomatoes, bananas, and pears are often picked unripe. And then, they are artificially &ldquo;ripened&rdquo; with ethylene gas.</p>
<p>Also, foods from local growers may contain less (or no) pesticides. Farmers have to pay an extra fee to become certified organic. Some small-scale farmers use organic methods but aren&rsquo;t certified because they simply aren&rsquo;t big enough to be able to afford the certification fees. Even if they aren&rsquo;t organic, small farmers tend to use fewer chemicals than large, industrialized farms.</p>
<p>If you can, talk to your farmers at your local market and ask them what (if any) pesticides they use. And be sure to wash your produce thoroughly to reduce your exposure to pesticides &mdash; which is especially important for pregnant women and children.</p>
<p><img height=""1022"" src=""https://foodrevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/blog-featured-buy_local-20171220-1400.jpg"" width=""1920"" /></p>
<h1>Why Buy Local Food? It Can Be Better for the Environment.</h1>
<p>Food is one of the leading drivers of climate change</p>
<p>Eating more local food reduces CO2 emissions by reducing food miles &mdash; the distance food travels from farm to consumer. The average piece of produce in the U.S. travels 1,500 miles, while local food may only travel 100 miles (or less), according to researcher Rich Pirog at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University.</p>
<p>Local food helps preserve green space. When local farmers are well compensated for their products, they are less likely to sell their land to developers. Likewise, with growing consumer demand, young farmers are increasingly likely to enter the marketplace by developing unused space, such as empty lots, into thriving urban gardens &mdash; many of which are grown organically.</p>
<p>Eating more local food can be one part of the solution. But, local is not the whole picture of food sustainability. The impact our food choices have on the environment includes many factors.</p>
<p>In some cases, food produced farther away may be more sustainable if it&rsquo;s grown more responsibly, if it carries a smaller ecological footprint, or if it&rsquo;s in season.</p>
<p>Choosing more plant-based foods is an important part of the equation as well. If you want to eat a more sustainable diet, look for foods that are local, organic, and low on the food chain. The higher the percentage of your protein intake that comes from plant foods, the more earth-friendly and healthful your diet will be.</p>
<h1>Other Reasons Why It&rsquo;s Important to Buy Local Foods</h1>
<p>Health and sustainability are two excellent reasons to eat more local food. But they&rsquo;re not the only reasons. Here are some surprising, and not-so-surprising, benefits:</p>
<p>Fresher food tastes better &ndash; When food is picked and eaten at the peak of freshness, it not only retains more nutrients, it also tastes better.<br />Small, local farms offer more variety. Our industrial agricultural system uses a monocrop system. But smaller, organic farmers may grow a variety of organic and heirloom produce, which you might not find at the supermarket.<br />Supporting local food aids your local economy. By choosing food produced locally, you&rsquo;re supporting your community, and you help keep local producers in business.<br />Local food creates community and connection. In our increasingly online and isolated world, loneliness is a growing problem. Getting to know your local growers and shopping or volunteering at a local farmer&rsquo;s market, co-op, or community supported agriculture (CSA) counteracts this trend. And doing so can help you build meaningful human connections.</p>

"Why Is Fiber Good For You? (And How To Get Enough Fiber!)","<h3><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;""><em>You&rsquo;ve heard fiber is important, but why is fiber good for you? And how can you get enough fiber? Discover all the health benefits of this essential nutrient, the best high fiber foods, and an easy way to challenge yourself to get more fiber in your daily diet.</em></span></h3>
<p>If you want to live a long, healthy life, fiber is a critical nutrient you need to be eating every day.</p>
<p>But fiber is often overlooked. And most people in developed countries aren&rsquo;t getting nearly enough of it.</p>
<p>Could your diet be lacking fiber? Probably so.</p>
<p>In fact, only 3% of Americans get the recommended amount of fiber. Most Americans get about 10-15 grams of fiber per day &mdash; a number that falls far short of the 40 grams per day recommended by leading experts.</p>
<p>So why is fiber good for you? It aids your body in absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating toxins. It fills you up and helps you maintain more consistent energy levels. And it&rsquo;s essential for healthy digestion, maintaining a healthy weight, preventing cancer and type 2 diabetes, and other proven health benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Is Fiber the Real &ldquo;Fountain of Youth&rdquo;?</h1>
<p>We hear a lot about the power of superfoods to extend our lives and keep us well. But it could be that fiber is better than all of them!</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Epidemiology suggests how powerful fiber consumption is to human health. Researchers analyzed 17 studies, including nearly a million participants, and found that every 10 grams of fiber consumed per day cut mortality risk by 10 percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What Is Fiber, Exactly?</h1>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard that you need to eat more fiber. But what is fiber?</p>
<p>Fiber is found in the cell walls of plants, where it provides structure and functions as sort of as a skeleton. It&rsquo;s not digestible by humans, so it doesn&rsquo;t provide nutrients or calories. But it&rsquo;s critical to your health anyway.</p>
<p>There are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Each performs a different job in your body.</p>
<p>Soluble fiber helps lower blood glucose levels and cholesterol, and is found in foods, such as oatmeal, beans, and legumes, as well as in some fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Insoluble fiber acts like a broom, cleaning out your digestive tract, and is found in foods, such as whole grains, kidney beans, bran, and fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Both soluble and insoluble fiber are found naturally in plant foods. Meat, dairy products, eggs, and oils do not contain any fiber. And processed foods made with sugar or white flour generally contain very little fiber because any natural fiber is lost or removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Fiber is Necessary for Maintaining a Healthy Digestive System</h1>
<p>Fiber is known for its ability to keep you regular and reduce constipation, but it has other benefits for maintaining healthy digestion as well.</p>
<p>For example, diverticulitis &ndash; inflammation of the intestine &ndash; is one of the most common age-related digestive disorders in the modern world.</p>
<p>According to a study published in the Journal of Nutrition, consuming foods rich in insoluble fiber has been found to reduce the risk of diverticulitis by 40%!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Fiber is Essential for Maintaining a Healthy Weight</h1>
<p>By increasing your fiber intake by only 14 grams per day, you can reduce your calorie intake by 10 percent, while increasing your sense of &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Soluble fiber mixes with water in the gut to create a gel. This gel-like substance slows the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream while triggering stretch receptors in your stomach, telling you you&rsquo;ve had enough. So, you feel full and satisfied by eating the same volume of food, even when that food has fewer calories.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;""><em><img height=""799"" src=""http://local.codazon.com/unlimited/admin/cms/wysiwyg/directive/___directive/e3ttZWRpYSB1cmw9Ind5c2l3eWcvY29kYXpvbi9tYWluLWNvbnRlbnQtMTAvYmxvZy0wMi0xLnBuZyJ9fQ%2C%2C/"" width=""1500"" /></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Fiber Plays a Critical Role in Cancer Prevention</h1>
<p>Fiber is an essential part of your waste removal system &ndash; constantly eliminating carcinogens before they become a problem. For instance, fiber works to prevent colorectal cancer by improving intestinal transit time &ndash; literally sweeping away carcinogens.</p>
<p>In a study at the National Cancer Institute called the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT), published in the Journal of Nutrition, participants were put on a high-fiber diet with an abundance of fruits and vegetables. Researchers focused on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas (polyps).</p>
<p>After adjusting for variables, it was found that the one food that made the most difference in whether or not participants had a recurrence of adenomas was the amount of beans they consumed. Many researchers believe this is because beans were the highest source of dietary fiber for most of the study participants.</p>
<p>But, fiber doesn&rsquo;t just reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. It also reduces the risk of other forms of cancer as well, including cancers of the breast, prostate, mouth, and throat.</p>
<p>Every 10 grams of fiber you eat is associated with a 10 percent reduced risk of colorectal cancer and a 5 percent fall in breast cancer risk, according to a study published in the Annals of Oncology.</p>
<p>Another study published in Pediatrics showed how women who consumed 28 grams per day of fiber had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate 14 grams per day.</p>
<p>The women who consumed the higher amount of dietary fiber also reduced their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer by 16 percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Fiber Is Good for Heart Health</h1>
<p>Many cardiologists recommend eating oatmeal for breakfast. Their #1 reason? Oatmeal is full of soluble fiber.</p>
<p>Researchers don&rsquo;t yet fully understand the mechanisms behind fiber&rsquo;s LDL (&ldquo;bad&rdquo;) cholesterol-lowering power, but according to a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the soluble fiber from oats can decrease LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL (&ldquo;good&rdquo;) cholesterol.</p>
<p>In a review and meta-analysis of 22 different publications in the BMJ, greater dietary fiber was found to be associated with a lower risk of both cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease.</p>
<p>High-fiber foods may also have other benefits for heart health, such as reducing blood pressure and inflammation.</p>

"Why the Global Rise in Vegan and Plant-Based Eating Isn’t A Fad","<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">Get an overview of vegan statistics from around the world. See why so many people are going vegan and eating plant-based — from athletes to celebrities to everyday people. The rise of plant-based diets is here to stay.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">Diets that limit or exclude meat, dairy products, and eggs used to be on the fringe and were seen as fads. Identifying as vegetarian, vegan, or plant-based was often viewed as weird or extreme — more the domain of hippies and activists than of large numbers of everyday people.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">Until recently, references to vegan eating in the mainstream media were often negative. And meat-free food options weren’t universally available or appetizing. But now, all that is changing.</span></em></h3>
<p><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Much of the world is trending towards plant-based eating — and this global shift could be here to stay.</h1>
<p>Millennials are central drivers of this worldwide shift away from consuming animal products. But the plant-based movement is bigger than any one generation. Everyone from celebrities to athletes to entire companies including Google and countries as big as China are supporting the movement to eat more plant-based foods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plant-based eating may not be entirely mainstream yet. But it’s becoming more accepted every day. And this trend is having far-reaching impacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Vegan Statistics: Incredible Signs the Global Demand for Plant-Based Foods Is Rising</h1>
<p>First of all, according to a forecast report by restaurant consultancy group Baum + Whiteman in New York, “plant-based” will be the food trend of 2018. The report also anticipates that plant-based foods will become the new organic.</p>
<p>In addition, Nestlé, the largest food company in the world, predicts that plant-based foods will continue to grow and … this trend is “here to stay.”</p>
<p>Another company, international delivery service Just Eat named veganism as a top consumer trend in 2018 — due to a 94% increase in “healthy food ordered.”</p>
<p>And similarly, according to data released by GrubHub, the top takeaway marketplace in the U.S., orders for plant-based food have reached a new high. In particular, users chose vegan food 19% more in the first half of 2017 than in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Here’s more compelling proof to prove the global demand for plant-based foods is increasing:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Search data from Google Trends shows an impressive worldwide increase in the interest in veganism from 2004 to 2018. Top regions include Israel, Australia, Canada, Austria, and New Zealand.</li>
<li>There’s been a 600% increase in people identifying as vegans in the U.S in the last three years. According to a report by research firm GlobalData, only 1% of U.S. consumers claimed to be vegan in 2014. And in 2017, that number rose to 6%.</li>
<li>In the UK, the number of people identifying as vegans has increased by 350%, compared to a decade ago, according to research commissioned by the Vegan Society in partnership with Vegan Life magazine.</li>
<li>Veganism was a top search trend in Canada in 2017. And the preliminary draft of Canada’s new Food Guide, released in 2017 by the Canadian government, favors plant-based foods.</li>
<li>In Portugal, vegetarianism rose by 400% in the last decade. This is according to research carried out by Nielsen.</li>
<li>Plant-based diets are growing across Asia. New dietary guidelines released by the Chinese government encourage the nation’s 1.3 billion people to reduce their meat consumption by 50%. Research predicts that China’s vegan market will grow more than 17% between 2015 and 2020. And in Hong Kong, 22% of the population reports practicing some form of a plant-based diet.</li>
<li>In Australia, between 2014 and 2016, the number of food products launched carrying a vegan claim rose by 92%. And Australia is the third-fastest growing vegan market in the world.</li>
<li>Mainstream health organizations are recommending a plant-based diet. Including, among others: Kaiser Permanente, the largest healthcare organization in the U.S.; the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee; and the American Institute for Cancer Research.</li>
<li>Even Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is asking its suppliers to offer more plant-based products.</li>

"10 Powerful Purple Vegetables You Should Be Eating — and Why","<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">Purple vegetables may be pretty, but they also have powerful health benefits. See why and get mouthwatering recipes for 10 purple vegetables.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">The color purple often symbolizes royalty and magic. And lately, purple vegetables have been popping up in more places.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">You might have seen shades of purple in your grocery store or local farmers market &mdash; from vibrant purple cauliflower to the darker skins of purple potatoes.</span></em></h3>
<h3><em><span style=""font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino;"">But are these colorful veggies really worth seeking out and including in your regular meals? Should you become passionate about naturally hued purple foods?</span></em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Let&rsquo;s Take A Look At Why Some Vegetables Are Purple</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purple foods are nothing new. In fact, you&rsquo;ve likely been eating some purple vegetables since childhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And purple veggies have been around for a long time. Some vegetables are naturally purple, like eggplant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And some are purple because farmers bred them to be colorful, like purple cauliflower. For thousands of years, humans have been tweaking the genetics of foods &mdash; naturally!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process is called selective breeding. Unlike genetically modifying foods, it&rsquo;s a slower process. Farmers select and grow crops with desired traits over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Should You Eat More Purple Vegetables?</h1>
<p>The deep purple color of fruits and veggies is usually a sign these foods have a good dose of antioxidants.</p>
<p>A particular type of antioxidant called anthocyanins gives plants (including flowers) their vivid violet colors. (They also give red foods, like tomatoes, and blue foods, like blueberries, their colors.)</p>
<p>Anthocyanins protect purple vegetables from sunlight damage, cold temperatures, and other stressors. And they attract pollinators, like bees and butterflies.</p>
<p>They also can help protect and heal your cells from damage and protect you from many lifestyle diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurological diseases.</p>
<p>For centuries, people have used anthocyanins in herbal medicines (from dried leaves, berries, roots, and seeds).</p>
<p>And mixtures and extracts with anthocyanins have been used for a wide range of health conditions. Including everything from hypertension and liver disorders to kidney stones and urinary tract infections &mdash; and the common cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>4 More Reasons to Eat More Purple Foods</h1>
<p>Anthocyanins have a wide range of health-promoting benefits.</p>
<p>Science is showing that they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Inflammatory</strong> &mdash; Anthocyanins have consistently shown to reduce inflammation. Why is this important? Because chronic inflammation is one of the underlying causes of many diseases of our times. Including Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, asthma, heart disease, allergies, type 2 diabetes, arthritis and joint disease, depression, some types of cancer, and obesity.</li>
<li><strong>Heart Healthy</strong> &mdash; Consuming a high amount of anthocyanins has been shown by a 2012 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition to improve many cardiovascular risk factors, including ability to lower artery stiffness and lower blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Cancer</strong> &mdash; Anthocyanins are associated with cancer prevention. For example, a 2013 study published in Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research suggests that purple sweet potato may protect against colorectal cancer &mdash; the third most common cancer. And purple corn, though difficult to find, may have particularly potent cancer-fighting power. In research by Monica Giusti, PhD, purple corn showed significant blockage of colon cancer cells.</li>
<li><strong>Good for Your Brain</strong> &mdash; A 2003 study published in the Archives of Pharmacal Research showed the memory-enhancing effects of eating purple sweet potatoes. Other research points to the ability of anthocyanins to help prevent age-related decline in the nervous system. And anthocyanins are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and localize inside brain regions involved in learning and memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers haven&rsquo;t focused on anthocyanins as much as other flavonoids, so even more benefits could be found.</p>
<h1>6 Purple Vegetables and How to Eat Them</h1>
<p>Are you ready to play with more purple on your plate?</p>
<p>Even picky eaters might be tempted to try some of these colorful veggies.</p>
<h2>1. Purple Cabbage &mdash; Also Known As Red Cabbage</h2>
<p><br />You should be able to find purple cabbage fairly easily. And it&rsquo;s one of the best healthy food bargains because it has the highest level of antioxidants per dollar.</p>
<p>Purple cabbage is also a cruciferous vegetable, so it gives you all the excellent health benefits of the brassica family &mdash; including fighting cancer, relief from depression, and more.</p>
<p>The leaves are thicker than green cabbage, but the taste is similar. You can easily substitute purple cabbage for green cabbage in recipes. You can even use purple cabbage to make visually appealing cabbage rolls with your favorite filling.</p>
<p>Purple cabbage goes well in salads. Try this Loaded Veggie Chopped Salad from Veggie Inspired.</p>
<p>This beautiful chopped salad is a perfect way to eat the rainbow. Almost every color of the spectrum is represented, including a heap of beautiful purple cabbage.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid sweeteners, you can leave the maple syrup out of the dressing. Or for an alternative, you can replace it with a soaked date and puree the dressing rather than whisk it together.</p>
<p>Or try this Red Cabbage Salad from Responsible Eating and Living. The homemade prune butter is easy to prepare and makes this salad extra special and delicious.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/codazon/main-content-10/blog-05-1.jpg&quot;}}"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Purple Onion &mdash; You&rsquo;ll Find Them Labeled As Red Onion</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next to purple cabbage, this is probably the most affordable and easiest-to-find purple vegetable out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 2017 study published in Food Research International found that the combination of quercetin and anthocyanin makes purple (also known as red) onions powerful cancer-fighters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use these onions in most recipes that call for sweet onion. The red onion may add color to your foods. For example, it will turn pickle brine hot pink.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this recipe for Easiest Quick Pickled Onions from What Great Grandma Ate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make some pickled onions and keep them in your fridge &mdash; they might even become one of the healthy staple foods you keep on hand all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They add depth and flavor to many savory dishes. Add them to sandwiches in place of raw onions. Spoon them over chili. Or use them in your next Buddha bowl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try this Fresh Pineapple Salsa from Veggies Save the Day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fruit salsas are a versatile condiment. And they&rsquo;re a great way to bring an abundance of flavor to any dish. You can scoop this pineapple salsa onto tacos, burgers, and salads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Purple Carrots &mdash; Now Available in More Stores and Markets</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might be surprised to learn that carrots weren&rsquo;t always orange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were domesticated in the Afghanistan region about a thousand years ago, at which time they were purple and yellow. Orange carrots didn&rsquo;t arrive until the 1500s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purple carrots became available again because scientists discovered that purple carrots have special genes that orange carrots don&rsquo;t. These genes make them more resistant to diseases and pests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purple carrots, ranging from dark violet to reddish purple, can have an intensely sweet and sometimes peppery flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are a beautiful addition to salads and veggie plates &mdash; they have bright orange, yellow, or white cores when you cut them. But you can also cook them and use them in a variety of recipes without having a big impact on the flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this recipe for Za&rsquo;atar Spiced Rainbow Carrots from Plants-Rule.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""{{media url=&quot;wysiwyg/codazon/main-content-10/blog-05-2.jpg&quot;}}"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Purple Cauliflower &mdash; Bright and Beautiful</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This purple vegetable is showing up on more and more store shelves, as consumer demand for purple foods has increased. (You might also see lime green and orange-colored cauliflower.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purple cauliflower has 15% more antioxidants than the world famous antioxidant-superstar, kale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purple cauliflower retains its color after cooking, and it&rsquo;s said to have a milder flavor than white cauliflower, with a slightly sweeter, nuttier taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut it up and add it to salads for a delicious crunch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this recipe for Ginger Raw Slaw with Beet and Cauliflower from Trinity&rsquo;s Kitchen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This salad has an irresistible red wine color. You can even turn this slaw into a main dish by serving it over quinoa or your favorite whole grain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to avoid sweeteners, you can leave out the raisins and the coconut nectar in the dressing. And be sure to choose organic or non-GMO versions of tamari or shoyu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Purple Kale &mdash; More Intense Flavor Than Green or Black Kale</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have seen purple kale, with its green leaves and purple stems. This veggie is grown for eating but also for ornamental purposes (many people find it stunningly beautiful).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young, tender purple kale can be used in salads. And the more mature leaves are best when cooked (steaming works well).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this gorgeous Purple Kale and Pansy Salad from The View from Great Island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When making this kale salad, be sure to remove the entire stem and spine from the leaves because they can be a little tough to chew. You can also massage the kale with the dressing with your hands to make it easier to chew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want, you can use another sweetener in place of the honey, or leave it out. And to make it oil-free, leave out the oil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Purple Asparagus &mdash; Sweeter And A Beautiful Violet Color</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purple variety is less bitter and slighter sweeter than green asparagus. Enjoy it raw in salads (sprinkle with lemon juice or vinegar to boost the color) or cooked (though it loses most of its purple color when heated.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strips of purple asparagus are perfect alongside buckwheat noodles (which can be found gluten-free) in an Asian-inspired vinaigrette.</p>

<p>If you want, you can replace the oil in the dressing with an extra teaspoon of the brown rice vinegar. Also, be sure to choose organic or non-GMO corn when shopping for this salad.</p>
